# Blockchain-based Intellectual Property Protection

## Project Overview
This project introduces a blockchain-based system for securely managing intellectual property records. Developed using the Flask web framework, this system ensures that every transaction or record entry is verifiable and permanent, offering a groundbreaking solution to the challenges plaguing traditional intellectual property management systems.

## Features
- **Secure Registration**: Users can securely register IP records which are stored as immutable blocks on the blockchain.
- **Data Integrity**: Utilizes cryptographic hash functions to safeguard intellectual creations against unauthorized alterations and duplications.
- **Transparent Verification**: Each record encapsulates essential information such as the propertyâ€™s name, author, and date of registration, all verifiable through a public ledger.

## Installation
